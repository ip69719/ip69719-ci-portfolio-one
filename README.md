This project was created for an imaginary practice that offers occupational therapy services for children.

## UX

### Project Goals

The primary Project Goal is to create a marketing website for 'Little Achievers therapy services', a private paediatric occupational therapy practice.
The target audience are parents whose children experience development challenges.

### User Stories

*   User stories
    * First Time Visitor Goals
        * As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        * As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        * As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily locate organisation's contact details.

### Design choices

#### Typography

* Merienda One font was used to create an attractive and slightly playful logo for the site.
* The Open Sans font is the main font used throughout the whole website because it is simple and makes the page content easily readable. Open Sans was chosen for its legibility across web and mobile interfaces. The font is highly readable in small sizes and also looks great when used for headings.
* The space between letters was increased for headings to improve the readability of uppercase text.

#### Images

* Images were selected to support the project goal. The aim is to show children having fun during therapy sessions
